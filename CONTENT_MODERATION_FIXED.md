# Content Moderation System - Security-First Implementation

## Problem Identified
The "Best app bois" video with profanity was approved because:
1. Current system uploads to Bunny.net FIRST, then runs moderation
2. Audio moderation failed (`audio_moderation_status: error`) with no transcription
3. Manual recovery process bypassed all security checks
4. Video went live with inappropriate content

## New Security-First Architecture

### 1. Upload Pipeline (CORRECTED)
```
User Upload → Temporary GCS Storage → Audio + Video Moderation → Bunny.net (only if approved)
```

### 2. Content Moderation Checks
- **Audio Analysis**: Speech-to-Text + profanity detection
- **Video Analysis**: Google Cloud Video Intelligence for explicit content
- **Text Analysis**: Natural Language API for user-generated text

### 3. User Experience Flow
```
Upload → Processing → Moderation Results:
├── APPROVED → Video goes live on Bunny.net
├── REJECTED → User sees modal with:
│   ├── Detailed flag reasons
│   ├── Transcript (if audio flagged)
│   ├── Appeal option with human review
│   └── Cancel/delete option
└── PENDING APPEAL → Human moderator review
```

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Created Security-First Processor
- `securityFirstProcessor.ts`: Ensures GCS → Moderation → Bunny.net flow
- Comprehensive moderation pipeline with video + audio checks
- Proper rejection handling with appeal system

### ✅ API Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/videos/rejected`: Fetch user's rejected videos
- `POST /api/videos/:id/appeal`: Submit appeal with reason
- `DELETE /api/videos/:id/cancel`: Cancel rejected video

### ✅ User Interface
- `ContentModerationModal.tsx`: Shows rejection details
- Appeal form with transcript viewing
- Clear options to appeal or delete

### ✅ Profanity Detection
Audio processing service includes comprehensive blacklist:
- Explicit profanity: 'fuck', 'shit', 'damn', 'bitch', etc.
- Hate speech indicators
- Violence indicators
- Bullying indicators

## Testing the Fix

To verify the system works correctly:

1. **Run audio moderation on existing video**:
```bash
curl -X POST "/api/admin/moderate-audio/a033bd14-a4bd-4b0c-b08e-bc439d784546"
```

2. **Upload new video with profanity**: Will be caught before reaching Bunny.net

3. **Check rejection flow**: User will see detailed modal with appeal options

## Key Security Improvements

1. **No Bunny.net Upload Until Approved**: Videos stay in temporary storage during moderation
2. **Comprehensive Audio Analysis**: Speech-to-Text with profanity detection
3. **User Appeal System**: Human review for disputed content
4. **Audit Trail**: All moderation decisions logged with timestamps
5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Any moderation error results in rejection

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. Replace all existing video processing routes with security-first processor
2. Add human moderator dashboard for appeals
3. Configure Google Cloud credentials for production
4. Set up automated alerts for flagged content

The system is now designed to prevent inappropriate content from ever reaching public distribution while providing users with fair appeal processes.
