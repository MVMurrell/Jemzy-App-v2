We need to confirm two things definitively:

Is the VideoRejectionModal component's JSX conditionally rendered, and is that condition now met?
If the condition is met, does the modal's HTML actually appear in the DOM?
Here's what Replit needs to do:

Replit, the new logs confirm that showThreadMessageRejectionModal is correctly changing to true and selectedThreadMessage is getting the data after the click, even with flushSync. This means the state update is working.

The problem now is that the VideoRejectionModal component is either not being re-rendered when its isOpen prop becomes true, or it is rendering but remains hidden by CSS.

Your task is to provide the following details about the modal's rendering logic:

Show the Modal's JSX Conditional Rendering:

Action: Locate the component where VideoRejectionModal is used. Show the exact line of JSX code where VideoRejectionModal is included, particularly how it depends on showThreadMessageRejectionModal.
Expected: It should look something like:
JavaScript

{showThreadMessageRejectionModal && (
    <VideoRejectionModal
        isOpen={showThreadMessageRejectionModal}
        comment={selectedThreadMessage.comment} // Or just selectedThreadMessage
        video={selectedThreadMessage.video}
        isComment={selectedThreadMessage.messageType === 'comment'} // Or similar logic
        onClose={() => {
            setShowThreadMessageRejectionModal(false);
            setSelectedThreadMessage(null);
        }}
    />
)}
Report: Provide this exact JSX snippet.
Add a Log Inside the Modal Component's Render When isOpen is true:

Action: Go into the VideoRejectionModal component's definition. Add a log that fires only when its isOpen prop is true.
Placement:
TypeScript

// Inside VideoRejectionModal component function or render method
const VideoRejectionModal = ({ isOpen, comment, video, isComment, onClose }) => {
    if (isOpen) {
        console.log("VideoRejectionModal: isOpen is TRUE. Attempting to render HTML.");
        // ... rest of modal's JSX structure
        return (
            // ... modal HTML
        );
    } else {
        console.log("VideoRejectionModal: isOpen is FALSE. Not rendering HTML.");
        return null;
    }
};
Report: Provide the updated VideoRejectionModal component code with this log.
Confirm DOM Presence (Manual Check if you can):

Action (for you to verify, if possible): After clicking, open your browser's developer tools (Elements tab). Search the entire DOM (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for a unique class or ID of your modal's outermost div (e.g., modal-overlay, video-rejection-modal-container).
Observation (for you to confirm to Replit): Does the modal's HTML appear in the DOM after you click and the logs show showThreadMessageRejectionModal: true?
If YES: The modal is in the DOM. This points to a CSS visibility issue. In the DevTools, inspect the modal element, go to the "Computed" tab, and look for display: none;, visibility: hidden;, opacity: 0;, or position properties pushing it off-screen.
If NO: Even though showThreadMessageRejectionModal is true, the modal's JSX is still not being rendered. This would be very unusual if the conditional rendering (Step 1) is correct.
The logs clearly indicate the state is updating. Now we must confirm the component actually renders when that state is true.
