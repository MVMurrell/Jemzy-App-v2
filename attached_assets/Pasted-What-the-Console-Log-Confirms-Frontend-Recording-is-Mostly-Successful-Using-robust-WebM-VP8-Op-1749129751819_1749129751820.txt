What the Console Log Confirms:

Frontend Recording is (Mostly) Successful:

Using robust WebM VP8/Opus recording: video/webm; codecs="vp8,opus" - Good, you're recording to a reliable WebM format.
Data chunk received, size: ... - Data is being collected.
Final blob created, size: 1285447 type: video/webm;codecs=vp8,opus - The Blob is created with a reasonable size and correct type.
üîç Testing local video playback before upload...
‚úÖ Local Playback: Video loaded metadata successfully! - Crucial! This means the browser itself can understand the video file you've just recorded. This rules out fundamental corruption of the WebM header or the file structure from the browser's perspective.
‚úÖ Local Playback: Video dimensions: 640x480 - Confirms video data is present.
‚úÖ Local Playback: Ready state: 4 - Indicates the video is fully loaded and ready to play.
‚úÖ Local Playback: Video can start playing - Further confirmation of local playability.
The New Problem: Duration: Infinity seconds

Final recording duration captured: 3.803 seconds (This is your internal duration tracker, which is good)
‚úÖ Local Playback: Duration: Infinity seconds - This is the smoking gun!
Preview video duration change: Infinity
Using actual recorded duration: 0 seconds (This is likely derived from the Infinity property).
Upload Failure:

The Root Cause: MediaRecorder Producing WebM with Missing/Corrupted Duration Metadata
Even though the browser can decode and play the video (because it's streamable and adaptive), the MediaRecorder is creating a WebM file where the duration metadata is either missing or incorrectly set to Infinity.

FFmpeg (which Bunny.net uses internally, and which your backend uses for pre-transcoding) is very sensitive to proper metadata, especially duration. If it sees Infinity or a missing duration, it often interprets the file as a live stream or an unfinalized file, leading to:

0 bytes, 0 seconds on Bunny.net: Bunny's transcoder thinks the video is still ongoing or cannot determine its length, so it doesn't finalize the file.
Backend FFmpeg issues: If your backend FFmpeg is trying to process this Infinity-duration file, it might also struggle, leading to errors like "moov atom not found" (even though WebM doesn't have a moov atom in the same way MP4 does, it's a generic way to describe missing essential metadata), or just failing silently to produce output.
Solution: Force the Duration Metadata on the Frontend or Fix it with FFmpeg
You have two primary approaches:

Option 1: Fix Duration on Frontend (Preferred if possible)
Ideally, you want MediaRecorder to produce correct metadata. This sometimes happens if the MediaRecorder is stopped too abruptly or if there's a browser bug.

Ensure mediaRecorder.stop() is explicitly called and onstop fully processes.
Minimalistic mimeType: Re-confirm that you're using just 'video/webm' or 'video/webm; codecs="vp8"' (no audio codec if not needed, but Opus is fine). Sometimes simpler mimeTypes behave better.
Check Browser Version: Are you using a very old or very new beta browser? Try in a stable Chrome/Firefox.
If MediaRecorder persists in outputting Infinity duration, you'll need to force the duration metadata with FFmpeg on the backend.

Option 2: Force Duration and Repair Metadata with FFmpeg on Backend (Most Robust)
This is the most reliable way to handle MediaRecorder quirks. You'll add FFmpeg flags that tell it to re-mux the video and explicitly set the duration based on its actual content, even if the input metadata is flawed.

Refined FFmpeg Command (Python example):

Python

# In your Python backend's transcode function:

# Added -t (duration), -strict experimental (for some aac), -fflags +genpts +discardcorrupt
ffmpeg_command = [
    "ffmpeg",
    "-err_detect", "aggressive",
    "-i", input_file_path,
    "-t", str(your_frontend_captured_duration), # <-- NEW: Pass the duration from frontend
    "-c:v", "libx264",
    "-preset", "veryfast",
    "-crf", "23",
    "-vf", "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2",
    "-pix_fmt", "yuv420p",
    "-profile:v", "high",
    "-level", "4.0",
    "-c:a", "aac",
    "-b:a", "128k",
    "-strict", "experimental", # Needed for some AAC profiles
    "-movflags", "faststart",
    "-threads", "0",
    "-y",
    # Aggressive input flags for corrupted files
    "-fflags", "+genpts", # Generate presentation timestamps if missing
    "-fflags", "+discardcorrupt", # Discard corrupted frames instead of aborting
    output_mp4_path
]
# ... (rest of the transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac_robust function) ...
Key additions to FFmpeg command:

-t [duration]: This is the most direct fix for the Infinity duration issue. You need to pass the 3.803 seconds (or whatever the actual duration is) from your frontend to your backend.
Your console log shows Final recording duration captured: 3.803 seconds. Send this duration along with the video Blob to your backend.
Your backend can then use this value in the -t flag.
How to send duration: Add it to your FormData object when uploading the video Blob.
JavaScript

// Frontend JS: in uploadVideo(videoBlob) function
formData.append("video", videoBlob, "recorded_video.webm");
formData.append("duration", mediaRecorder.duration); // or your accurately calculated duration
// ... then, on backend, parse this 'duration' field.
Backend Python (example):
Python

def handle_video_upload(request): # Assuming Flask/FastAPI request object
    video_file = request.files['video'] # Get the video file
    duration_str = request.form.get('duration') # Get the duration string
    duration = float(duration_str) if duration_str else None

    # ... (save temp_input_path) ...

    # Pass duration to transcode function
    if not transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac_robust(temp_input_path, output_mp4_path, duration):
        # ... error handling ...

# Update transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac_robust function signature
def transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac_robust(input_file_path, output_mp4_path, duration=None):
    ffmpeg_command = ["ffmpeg", "-i", input_file_path]
    if duration is not None:
        ffmpeg_command.extend(["-t", str(duration)]) # Add duration flag

    # ... (rest of the command, as above) ...
-fflags +genpts: This tells FFmpeg to generate presentation timestamps if they are missing or invalid in the input. This is very helpful for malformed streams.
-fflags +discardcorrupt: This instructs FFmpeg to discard corrupted frames instead of stopping the entire transcoding process.
-strict experimental: While aac is standard, some specific AAC profiles or FFmpeg builds might still require this flag for AAC encoding. It's good to include it for robustness.
Why this is likely the solution:
The "Local Playback: Video loaded metadata successfully!" and "Video can start playing" are strong indicators that the actual video and audio data in your Blob is fine. The Infinity duration is the metadata flaw. By explicitly telling FFmpeg the correct duration, you're overriding this error, and the additional -fflags help FFmpeg parse and rebuild the stream more resiliently.

Implement this change, ensuring you pass the duration from the frontend to your backend's FFmpeg command, and carefully monitor your Replit backend logs for FFmpeg's stderr output. It should now successfully create a valid MP4 for Bunny.net.
