The Most Effective Solutions (and how to diagnose):
1. Critical Frontend Self-Test: Is the Recorded Video Playable Locally?
This is the absolute first step. If the video recorded by your frontend cannot be played back by the browser itself (e.g., in a local <video> tag) before you send it to Replit, then the problem is unequivocally on the client-side recording process.

How to test:

JavaScript

// In your client-side JavaScript (e.g., VideoUploadModal.tsx logic)
mediaRecorder.onstop = async () => {
    const videoBlob = new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: mediaRecorder.mimeType }); 
    console.log("Recorded Blob type:", videoBlob.type);
    console.log("Recorded Blob size:", videoBlob.size, "bytes");

    // --- IMPORTANT: Play the Blob locally to verify ---
    const videoElement = document.createElement('video');
    videoElement.src = URL.createObjectURL(videoBlob);
    videoElement.controls = true;
    videoElement.style.maxWidth = '300px'; // For display
    document.body.appendChild(videoElement); // Append to body or a test div

    videoElement.onloadedmetadata = () => {
        console.log("Local Playback: Video loaded metadata successfully!");
        console.log("Local Playback: Duration:", videoElement.duration, "seconds");
        // Remove the video element after test if desired
        // document.body.removeChild(videoElement); 
    };

    videoElement.onerror = (e) => {
        console.error("Local Playback: Error playing video blob locally!", e);
        // This is your smoking gun! If it fails here, the problem is local recording.
    };
    // --- End Local Playback Test ---

    // Now, proceed with uploading the video if local playback is successful
    if (videoElement.readyState >= 1) { // Check if metadata loaded
        await uploadVideo(videoBlob); // Your existing upload function
    } else {
        console.error("Local playback failed. Not uploading problematic video.");
        // Inform the user that recording failed
    }

    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop()); // Stop camera/mic
};
If videoElement.onerror fires or onloadedmetadata never fires, your MediaRecorder setup is producing unplayable files. You need to fix that first.

2. Refine Frontend MediaRecorder Configuration:
If local playback fails, focus on the MediaRecorder options.

Try simpler mimeTypes: Sometimes specifying too many codecs or non-standard ones causes issues.
Most reliable WebM: 'video/webm' (let browser choose default VPx/Opus)
Most reliable MP4: 'video/mp4' (let browser choose default H.264/AAC, if it supports direct MP4 well)
Experiment with timeslice: Forcing timeslice (e.g., mediaRecorder.start(1000); for 1-second chunks) often helps MediaRecorder finalize the Blob correctly, especially for MP4.
Ensure stop() is properly called: Make sure mediaRecorder.stop() is reliably called, and you're waiting for the onstop event to collect all chunks.
3. Verify Frontend-to-Backend Data Transfer Integrity:
If the Blob plays locally, but the server receives garbage or an incomplete file, the problem is in the transfer.

Client-side uploadVideo function: Ensure it correctly appends the Blob to FormData and sends it via fetch.
JavaScript

async function uploadVideo(videoBlob) {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("video", videoBlob, "recorded_video.webm"); // or .mp4

    try {
        const response = await fetch('/your-replit-upload-endpoint', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData,
            // No 'Content-Type' header needed here; fetch sets it automatically for FormData
        });
        // ... (handle response) ...
    } catch (error) { /* ... */ }
}
Backend Replit receiving logic: How is your server/bunnyService.ts (if Node.js/TypeScript) or Python code receiving the uploaded file?
Are you correctly parsing multipart/form-data? Most web frameworks (Express/FastAPI/Flask with appropriate middleware/libraries like multer, formidable, Werkzeug) handle this.
Crucial Debugging: Immediately upon receiving the file on the backend, save the raw incoming bytes to a temporary file on Replit and check its size. Is it identical to the Blob.size reported on the frontend?
Python

# Python example for checking received file size
# Assuming `file` is the FileStorage object from Flask/FastAPI
file_bytes = file.read()
print(f"Received file size on backend: {len(file_bytes)} bytes")
temp_received_path = f"/tmp/received_{uuid.uuid4()}.{file.filename.split('.')[-1]}"
with open(temp_received_path, "wb") as f:
    f.write(file_bytes)
print(f"Saved raw received file to: {temp_received_path}")
# Now, try to run FFmpeg on *this* temp_received_path.
If the sizes don't match, or the received file is always 0 bytes, the issue is with the client-to-server file transfer, not FFmpeg or Bunny.net yet.
4. Aggressive FFmpeg "Fixing" (If Input is Mostly Valid):
If your local playback and backend receiving checks pass, but FFmpeg on Replit still chokes, try a more aggressive FFmpeg command to try and "fix" potentially malformed streams:

Python

# In your Python backend's transcode function:
# (Replace `transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac_robust` function)

ffmpeg_command = [
    "ffmpeg",
    "-err_detect", "aggressive", # Try to recover from more errors in input
    "-i", input_file_path,
    "-c:v", "libx264",
    "-preset", "veryfast",
    "-crf", "23",
    "-vf", "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2",
    "-pix_fmt", "yuv420p",
    "-profile:v", "high",
    "-level", "4.0",
    "-c:a", "aac",
    "-b:a", "128k",
    "-movflags", "faststart",
    "-threads", "0",
    "-y",
    output_mp4_path
]
# ... (rest of the transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac_robust function) ...
The -err_detect aggressive flag tells FFmpeg to be more tolerant of errors in the input stream and try harder to decode it.

5. Consider a Dedicated Client-Side Recording Library:
If all else fails, and your browser's MediaRecorder output remains consistently problematic, consider integrating a robust JavaScript recording library on your frontend. These libraries often wrap MediaRecorder and apply their own fixes, polyfills, and best practices to ensure reliable output across different browsers.

RecordRTC: A popular and well-maintained library for MediaRecorder
MediaStreamRecorder.js: Another option for stream recording.
These libraries handle complexities like:

Browser compatibility quirks
Correct Blob finalization
Consistent metadata writing
Sometimes even offering client-side basic transcoding or optimization before upload.
Summary of Debugging Flow:
Frontend Test: Can the browser play the video it just recorded locally?
NO: Fix your MediaRecorder setup (mimeType, timeslice, onstop handling).
YES: Proceed to step 2.
Backend Receive Test: Does the backend receive the complete and correct video data (same size as frontend Blob)?
NO: Fix your frontend upload mechanism or backend file reception/parsing.
YES: Proceed to step 3.
FFmpeg Test: Does FFmpeg on Replit successfully process the received file?
NO: Analyze FFmpeg's stderr output precisely. Try the -err_detect aggressive flag. If it's still "moov atom not found" or "DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN", the input is truly malformed.
YES: The problem is likely resolved, and the video should now upload successfully to Bunny.net.
The fact that DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN is mentioned indicates a deep-seated structural issue. You need to ensure the raw video output from the browser is fundamentally sound before it even reaches your backend's transcoding logic.
