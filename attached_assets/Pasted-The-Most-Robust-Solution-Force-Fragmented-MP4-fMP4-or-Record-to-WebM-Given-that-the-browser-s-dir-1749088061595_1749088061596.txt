The Most Robust Solution: Force Fragmented MP4 (fMP4) or Record to WebM
Given that the browser's direct MP4 output is causing issues, you have two primary, more robust strategies:

Strategy 1: Force Fragmented MP4 (fMP4) during browser recording (Recommended)
This is often the most elegant solution for browser-recorded video that will be processed by a backend. Fragmented MP4 (fMP4) writes the moov atom (or parts of it) incrementally throughout the file, rather than just at the end. This makes the file resilient to crashes or interruptions during recording, as each fragment is self-contained. FFmpeg is generally much better at handling fMP4.

How to implement this on the Frontend (JavaScript MediaRecorder API):

When initializing MediaRecorder, specify video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42001E" (for H.264 video) and then provide the timeslice option to emit data in chunks. This implicitly creates fMP4.

JavaScript

// Example for recording with MediaRecorder and forcing fMP4 on the frontend
let mediaRecorder;
let recordedChunks = [];
let stream; // Assuming 'stream' is obtained from navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()

async function startRecording() {
    recordedChunks = [];
    try {
        stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
        // Request MP4 format with H.264 video and AAC audio
        // The 'timeslice' option makes it a fragmented MP4 (fMP4)
        mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, { 
            mimeType: 'video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42001E, mp4a.40.2"', // Explicitly H.264 and AAC
            // Or just 'video/mp4' if the browser infers the best codecs (often H.264/AAC)
            // If still having issues, try 'video/webm; codecs="vp8,opus"' and let backend handle all transcoding.
        });

        mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
            if (event.data.size > 0) {
                recordedChunks.push(event.data);
                // For long recordings, you might upload chunks as they become available
                // instead of waiting for the entire recording to finish.
                // For 60-sec clips, waiting till 'onstop' might be fine.
            }
        };

        mediaRecorder.onstop = async () => {
            const videoBlob = new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: 'video/mp4' }); // Ensure correct MIME type
            console.log("Recorded MP4 blob:", videoBlob);
            await uploadVideo(videoBlob); // Your existing upload function
            stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop()); // Stop camera/mic
        };

        mediaRecorder.start(1000); // Record in 1-second chunks (creates fMP4)
        console.log("Recording started...");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error starting media recorder:", error);
    }
}

function stopRecording() {
    if (mediaRecorder && mediaRecorder.state !== 'inactive') {
        mediaRecorder.stop();
        console.log("Recording stopped.");
    }
}

// Ensure your `uploadVideo` function sends this blob correctly to your Replit backend.
// Your backend FFmpeg command should still include '-movflags faststart' and force AAC,
// as it will then be processing a robust fMP4.
Why this helps FFmpeg:

Resilience: FFmpeg can process fMP4 streams more robustly because the metadata is interleaved throughout the file, not just at the potentially missing end.
Faster Start: The movflags faststart in your FFmpeg command (which you should keep) is designed to move the moov atom to the beginning. When combined with fMP4 (where parts of it are already at the start), it helps ensure everything is where FFmpeg expects it.
Strategy 2: Revert to WebM recording on the Frontend (and let FFmpeg handle everything)
If forcing fMP4 still proves flaky or browser compatibility is an issue, go back to recording as WebM/VP8/Opus on the frontend. This is often the most universally reliable format for browser recording, even if it requires a full transcode on your backend.

How to implement this on the Frontend (JavaScript MediaRecorder API):

JavaScript

// Example for recording with MediaRecorder and forcing WebM on the frontend
let mediaRecorder;
let recordedChunks = [];
let stream;

async function startRecording() {
    recordedChunks = [];
    try {
        stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
        // Request WebM format with VP8 video and Opus audio
        mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, { 
            mimeType: 'video/webm; codecs="vp8,opus"' 
        });

        mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
            if (event.data.size > 0) {
                recordedChunks.push(event.data);
            }
        };

        mediaRecorder.onstop = async () => {
            const videoBlob = new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: 'video/webm' }); // Ensure correct MIME type
            console.log("Recorded WebM blob:", videoBlob);
            await uploadVideo(videoBlob); // Your existing upload function
            stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop()); // Stop camera/mic
        };

        mediaRecorder.start(); // No timeslice needed here unless you want chunked upload
        console.log("Recording started...");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error starting media recorder:", error);
    }
}

function stopRecording() {
    if (mediaRecorder && mediaRecorder.state !== 'inactive') {
        mediaRecorder.stop();
        console.log("Recording stopped.");
    }
}
What this means for your Backend (Replit FFmpeg):

Your backend FFmpeg command (transcode_to_mp4_h264_aac function) will now reliably receive a WebM input. It's already configured to output MP4 with H.264/AAC, which is exactly what Bunny.net needs. This bypasses the problematic MP4 creation directly by the browser.

Refined FFmpeg Command (Keep this on Backend)
Your FFmpeg command in the Replit backend should remain robust:

Python

# In your Python backend:
ffmpeg_command = [
    "ffmpeg",
    "-i", input_file_path,  # This will be your incoming WebM or the fMP4
    "-c:v", "libx264",
    "-preset", "veryfast",
    "-crf", "23",
    "-c:a", "aac",
    "-b:a", "128k",
    "-movflags", "faststart", # Keep this to ensure proper MP4 structure for Bunny.net
    "-threads", "0",
    "-y",
    output_mp4_path
]
Even if you use Strategy 1 (fMP4 on frontend), still run it through this FFmpeg command on the backend. This ensures the output is exactly what Bunny.net expects (H.264, AAC, standard MP4 structure), effectively acting as a final "standardization" step.

Debugging Workflow Moving Forward:
Frontend Console: Use your browser's developer console to check MediaRecorder logs. Confirm the Blob type and size when onstop fires.
Replit Logs:
Input File Size: Before calling FFmpeg, print the size of the temporary input file on your Replit server (os.path.getsize(temp_input_path)). Is it 0 bytes? If so, the issue is with how your frontend is sending the file or how your backend is receiving/saving it.
FFmpeg stderr: This is your best friend. Pay very close attention to the output from ffmpeg.stderr (the error stream). It will tell you precisely why FFmpeg is failing. If it's still "moov atom not found", it means the input file's structure is fundamentally broken for FFmpeg.
Output File Size: After FFmpeg runs, check the size of output_mp4_path. Is it 0 bytes? If FFmpeg fails, it won't produce a valid output.
Local Testing: If possible, try to save one of these problematic browser-recorded MP4 files locally from your frontend. Then, try running the exact same FFmpeg command on that file on your local machine. This can help isolate if the issue is Replit-specific or fundamentally with the browser's output.
I highly recommend Strategy 1 (fMP4) first, as it keeps the final file in MP4 which is generally preferred. If that still fails due to moov atom issues, then Strategy 2 (WebM frontend) is the most robust fallback. The key is to avoid relying on the browser's direct MP4 recording to be perfectly structured for all transcoders.
