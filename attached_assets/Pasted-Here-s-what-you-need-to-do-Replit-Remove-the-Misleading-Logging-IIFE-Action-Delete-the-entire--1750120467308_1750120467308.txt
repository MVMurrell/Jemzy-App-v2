Here's what you need to do, Replit:

Remove the Misleading Logging IIFE:

Action: Delete the entire IIFE block that starts with {(() => { ... and ends with })()} and return null;. It's causing confusion because its logs don't reflect the actual modal's rendering state.

-      })()}
      {showThreadMessageRejectionModal && selectedThreadMessage && (
        <VideoRejectionModal
// ... rest of modal
Add a Confirmatory Log Outside the Modal JSX:

Action: Add a log directly into the GroupProfilePage's return statement, outside the VideoRejectionModal's conditional, to confirm the props are ready for the modal.
JavaScript

// client/src/pages/group-profile.tsx (within the return of GroupProfilePage)
return (
    <div>
        {/* ... other content ... */}

        {/* New confirmation log */}
        {console.log("GroupProfilePage Render: Modal visibility state:", showThreadMessageRejectionModal, "Selected message:", selectedThreadMessage)}

        {showThreadMessageRejectionModal && selectedThreadMessage && (
            <VideoRejectionModal
                isOpen={showThreadMessageRejectionModal}
                // ...
            />
        )}
    </div>
);
Add a Clear Log Inside VideoRejectionModal When isOpen is true:

Action: Ensure your VideoRejectionModal component has a log that fires only when its isOpen prop is true, and is not returning null conditionally inside itself.
TypeScript

// Inside VideoRejectionModal component (VideoRejectionModal.tsx)
const VideoRejectionModal = ({ isOpen, comment, video, isComment, onClose }) => {
    if (isOpen) {
        console.log("ðŸŸ¢ VideoRejectionModal: isOpen is TRUE. Attempting to render HTML now!");
        // ... the rest of your modal's actual JSX structure
        return (
            // Your modal's overlay and content JSX
            <div className="modal-overlay">
                <div className="modal-content">
                    {/* ... modal content ... */}
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    } else {
        console.log("ðŸ”´ VideoRejectionModal: isOpen is FALSE. Returning null.");
        return null; // This is the expected and correct behavior when not open
    }
};
PERFORM A DIRECT DOM INSPECTION (This is the critical step now):

Action:
Run your app.
Open your browser's Developer Tools (Elements tab).
Click on a flagged video message to trigger the modal.
IMMEDIATELY after clicking, and while the modal should be open:
In the "Elements" tab, use the search function (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to search for a unique class name or ID that you know is on the outermost div of your VideoRejectionModal (e.g., modal-overlay, video-rejection-modal).
Report:
Does the HTML structure of your VideoRejectionModal appear in the DOM tree anywhere after you click?
If YES: This means the modal is rendering, but it's hidden by CSS. In the DevTools, inspect that modal element in the "Elements" tab, then go to the "Computed" tab and list the values for display, visibility, opacity, position, z-index, top, left, right, and transform. Also, look for any parent elements that might have overflow: hidden or lower z-index values.
If NO: This would be highly unexpected given all the previous logs. If the HTML is truly not in the DOM, it implies the showThreadMessageRejectionModal && selectedThreadMessage condition is still somehow evaluating to false despite the state being true, which would be a very deep and rare React issue (e.g., if selectedThreadMessage becomes null right after being set, or if the component itself is somehow not stable).
My strong suspicion is that the modal's HTML will be in the DOM now, and the problem is a CSS visibility issue.
