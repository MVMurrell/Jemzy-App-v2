Consequences for Violations: Our Strike System
When content is confirmed by our human review team to violate our Community Guidelines, we implement a "strike system" to address repeat offenses. The severity of the consequence escalates with the number and gravity of violations.
Please Note: The type of content (video or comment) does not change the core policy or the consequences once a violation is confirmed. Both are treated equally under our Community Guidelines. However, particularly egregious content (e.g., illegal content, direct threats, child sexual abuse material) will result in immediate and severe action, bypassing the strike system entirely.
First Violation (Warning):


The violating content (video or comment) will be removed.
You will receive a warning notification explaining which Community Guideline was violated. This is an educational opportunity to help you understand our policies better.
No immediate impact on account functionality.
Second Violation (Temporary Account Suspension):


The violating content will be removed.
Your account will be temporarily suspended for a period (e.g., 24 hours to 7 days, depending on severity). During this time, you will not be able to post new content, comment, or interact with the app.
You may be required to review our Community Guidelines before your account access is fully restored.
Third Violation (Extended Account Suspension):


The violating content will be removed.
Your account will face an extended temporary suspension (e.g., 30 days or more).
Repeated or Egregious Violations (Permanent Account Ban):


We reserve the right to permanently ban any user's account at any time if they repeatedly violate our Community Guidelines or engage in severe, harmful behavior.
When an account is permanently banned, you will lose access to your account and all content associated with it. Attempts to circumvent a ban by creating new accounts will also result in immediate banning of the new accounts.
Appeals Process:
If you believe your content was removed or your account was penalized in error, you have the right to appeal our decision. Instructions for submitting an appeal will be provided in your notification. Our human review team will re-examine your case.
