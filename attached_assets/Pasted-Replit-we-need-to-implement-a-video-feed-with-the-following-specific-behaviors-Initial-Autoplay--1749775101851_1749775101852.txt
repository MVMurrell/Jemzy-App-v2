Replit, we need to implement a video feed with the following specific behaviors:

Initial Autoplay: When the feed is first opened, the very first video should automatically start playing.
Sequential Playback on Scroll: Other videos should remain paused (or unloaded) and only begin playing when the user scrolls to them and they become the primary visible video.
One-Video-at-a-Time Scrolling: The scrolling mechanism should advance the feed precisely by one video unit, creating a "snap" or "paging" effect, preventing users from scrolling through multiple videos too quickly.
Resource Efficiency: Only the currently visible video should actively play, and others should be paused/unloaded to conserve bandwidth and CPU.
Bunny.net Streaming: All videos are streamed from Bunny.net storage.
This requires a combination of precise CSS for the scrolling behavior and JavaScript for smart playback control.

I. Frontend: Structuring the Video Feed with CSS Scroll Snap

This is the most efficient and native-feeling way to achieve the "one video at a time" scrolling.

Create a Scrollable Container:

Action: Create a parent div (e.g., video-feed-container) that will serve as the scrollable viewport for your videos.
CSS: Apply the following CSS properties to this container:
CSS

.video-feed-container {
    height: 100vh; /* Make it full viewport height to fit one video */
    overflow-y: scroll; /* Enable vertical scrolling */
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory; /* Crucial: Enables vertical snapping, must snap */
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; /* Smooth scrolling on iOS */
    overscroll-behavior-y: contain; /* Prevents background scrolling when snapped */
    scroll-behavior: smooth; /* Optional: for smoother programmatic scrolls */
    /* Add any background or padding if needed */
}
Define Individual Video Items:

Action: Each video (and its associated info like title, description) should be wrapped in its own distinct child element (e.g., video-feed-item).
CSS: Apply the following CSS properties to each video item:
CSS

.video-feed-item {
    scroll-snap-align: start; /* Crucial: Each item snaps to the start of the container */
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%; /* Make each item fill the container height */
    flex-shrink: 0; /* Prevents items from shrinking in flex/grid contexts */
    display: flex; /* Use flexbox for easy content alignment within the item */
    flex-direction: column; /* Stack video and info vertically */
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    position: relative; /* For overlays/error messages */
    /* Add padding or margin as needed for spacing between snapped items */
}

/* The actual video element inside the item */
.video-feed-item video {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%; /* Make video fill its parent item */
    object-fit: cover; /* Ensures video covers the area, cropping if necessary */
    background-color: black; /* Good fallback for aspect ratio differences */
}
HTML Structure (Conceptual - e.g., using React/JSX):
HTML

<div class="video-feed-container">
    {videos.map((videoData, index) => (
        <div key={videoData.id} id={`video-item-${videoData.id}`} className="video-feed-item">
            <video
                id={`video-player-${videoData.id}`}
                src={videoData.bunny_stream_url}
                preload="none"       /* Important for lazy loading */
                muted               /* CRITICAL for autoplay policies */
                playsInline         /* CRITICAL for mobile (iOS) */
                loop                /* Optional: loop videos automatically */
                // Add onError handler here as per previous instructions
            ></video>
            {/* Display video title, description, user info, etc. */}
            <div class="video-info">
                <h3>{videoData.title}</h3>
                <p>{videoData.description}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
II. Frontend: Dynamic Video Playback Control with Intersection Observer

This is the JavaScript logic that manages play(), pause(), and initial autoplay.

Initialize Intersection Observer:

Goal: Efficiently detect when video elements enter or leave the primary viewport area.
Action: Create a single IntersectionObserver instance.
Threshold: Set a threshold of 0.8 or 1.0. This means the callback will fire when 80% or 100% of the video item is visible, ensuring it's truly the "active" video.
Implement the Observer Callback Logic:

Goal: Manage play() and pause() actions based on visibility.
Action: Write the IntersectionObserver callback function that will be executed when elements intersect the viewport.
JavaScript

let currentlyPlayingVideoElement = null; // Keeps track of the video currently playing

const handleIntersection = (entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
        const videoContainer = entry.target; // This is the .video-feed-item div
        const videoPlayer = videoContainer.querySelector('video'); // Get the actual video element inside

        if (videoPlayer) {
            if (entry.isIntersecting && entry.intersectionRatio >= 0.8) {
                // This video is now mostly in view (the active one)
                if (currentlyPlayingVideoElement && currentlyPlayingVideoElement !== videoPlayer) {
                    currentlyPlayingVideoElement.pause(); // Pause the previously playing video
                    // Optional: Reset time if you want it to restart when scrolled back
                    // currentlyPlayingVideoElement.currentTime = 0;
                }

                // Play the current video
                if (videoPlayer.paused) { // Only play if it's not already playing
                    videoPlayer.play().catch(error => {
                        console.error(`Video autoplay prevented or failed for ID: ${videoPlayer.id}`, error);
                        // This usually happens if 'muted' is false and there's no user gesture.
                        // You might want to show a visible "Play" button or "Unmute" prompt here.
                    });
                    currentlyPlayingVideoElement = videoPlayer; // Set current playing video
                }
            } else {
                // This video is no longer primarily in view (scrolled out)
                if (videoPlayer === currentlyPlayingVideoElement || !videoPlayer.paused) {
                    videoPlayer.pause(); // Pause it
                    // Optional: If you want to aggressively manage resources, you could also:
                    // videoPlayer.removeAttribute('src'); // Unload source
                    // videoPlayer.load(); // Reset player state (requires setting src again later)
                }
                if (videoPlayer === currentlyPlayingVideoElement) {
                    currentlyPlayingVideoElement = null; // Clear if it was the one playing
                }
            }
        }
    });
};

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(handleIntersection, {
    threshold: [0, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0] // Observe at different visibility percentages
});

// After your video feed component has rendered all its video items:
// Query all video item wrappers and start observing them
document.querySelectorAll('.video-feed-item').forEach(item => {
    observer.observe(item);
});
Initial Autoplay for the First Video:

Goal: Ensure the very first video plays when the feed loads.
Action: After your component has rendered and the IntersectionObserver is set up, explicitly target the first video player and call play() on it. This might be done in a useEffect hook (for React) or equivalent lifecycle method, ensuring it runs after the DOM is ready.
Example (e.g., in a React useEffect after component mount):
JavaScript

// Assuming your video feed component mounts
useEffect(() => {
    const firstVideoItem = document.querySelector('.video-feed-item');
    if (firstVideoItem) {
        const firstVideoPlayer = firstVideoItem.querySelector('video');
        if (firstVideoPlayer) {
            firstVideoPlayer.muted = true; // Ensure it's muted for reliable autoplay
            firstVideoPlayer.play().catch(error => {
                console.error('Initial autoplay of first video failed:', error);
                // Fallback: Show a prominent play button or unmute button if autoplay fails
            });
            currentlyPlayingVideoElement = firstVideoPlayer; // Set initial playing video
        }
    }

    // ... (setup Intersection Observer here as well)

    // Cleanup function if using React useEffect
    return () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('.video-feed-item').forEach(item => {
            observer.unobserve(item);
        });
        if (currentlyPlayingVideoElement) {
            currentlyPlayingVideoElement.pause();
        }
    };
}, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once after mount
III. Video Element Attributes for Performance and Control:

preload="none":
Action: Add this attribute to all <video> tags.
Purpose: This tells the browser not to pre-download any video data until playback is initiated. Crucial for saving bandwidth when you have many videos in the feed.
muted:
Action: Add this attribute to all <video> tags.
Purpose: Most browsers (especially mobile) enforce autoplay policies. Videos can typically only autoplay if they are muted. Provide an unmute button in your UI.
playsInline:
Action: Add this attribute to all <video> tags.
Purpose: On iOS Safari, this prevents videos from automatically going full-screen when they start playing, allowing them to play directly within your feed.
loop (Optional):
Action: Add this if you want videos to loop continuously when playing.
Summary of Instructions & Deliverables for Replit:

Implement CSS Scroll Snap: Apply the provided CSS to your video-feed-container and video-feed-item elements to achieve the one-video-at-a-time scrolling effect.
Set Essential Video Attributes: Ensure all your <video> tags have preload="none", muted, and playsInline. You can also add loop if desired.
Implement JavaScript Playback Control with Intersection Observer:
Set up the IntersectionObserver as described, observing each video-feed-item.
Write the callback logic to play() the visible video and pause() others.
Add explicit logic to ensure the very first video autoplays on initial load (remembering the muted requirement).
Provide Frontend Code Snippets: Show the updated CSS, HTML/JSX structure for your video feed, and the JavaScript logic for the IntersectionObserver and initial autoplay.
Demonstration: Provide a short video or GIF demonstrating the smooth scroll-snap effect and how videos correctly auto-play/pause as you scroll one by one.
This comprehensive approach will give your users a polished, engaging, and resource-efficient video feed experience.
