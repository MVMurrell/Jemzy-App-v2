Replit, the logs now clearly show that showThreadMessageRejectionModal is successfully changing to true and selectedThreadMessage is getting the correct data after the click. The problem is that the VideoRejectionModal component is not receiving isOpen: true to trigger its rendering.

Please provide the following code:

The useState declarations:

Show the exact lines where showThreadMessageRejectionModal and selectedThreadMessage are defined using useState.
Context: Show the component function/class definition where these useState calls reside.
Example:

TypeScript

// In SomeParentComponent.tsx or similar
const SomeParentComponent = () => {
    const [showThreadMessageRejectionModal, setShowThreadMessageRejectionModal] = useState(false);
    const [selectedThreadMessage, setSelectedThreadMessage] = useState(null);

    // ... rest of component logic
};
The JSX where VideoRejectionModal is conditionally rendered:

Show the exact JSX code where <VideoRejectionModal /> is used.
Context: Show it within the return statement or render method of the component that uses the showThreadMessageRejectionModal state.
Example:

JavaScript

// In SomeParentComponent.tsx or similar
return (
    <div>
        {/* ... other content */}
        {showThreadMessageRejectionModal && selectedThreadMessage && (
            <VideoRejectionModal
                isOpen={showThreadMessageRejectionModal}
                comment={selectedThreadMessage.comment}
                video={selectedThreadMessage.video}
                isComment={selectedThreadMessage.isComment}
                onClose={() => { /* ... */ }}
            />
        )}
    </div>
);
Confirm the DOM Presence (Crucial Verification):

Action: After clicking the message (and seeing the ðŸ”„ State change detected - showThreadMessageRejectionModal: true logs), manually open your browser's Developer Tools (Elements tab).
Action: Search the entire DOM (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for a unique class name or ID that you know is on the outermost div or element of your VideoRejectionModal.
Report:
Does the VideoRejectionModal's HTML structure (its <divs>, etc.) actually appear in the DOM tree anywhere after you click?
If YES: This would be very strange given the logs, but it would imply a CSS hiding issue despite the VideoRejectionModal - NOT RENDERING log. In this case, please provide the computed CSS styles for the modal's outermost element.
If NO: This is what the logs currently suggest. If the showThreadMessageRejectionModal state is true, but the modal's HTML is not in the DOM, then there's an issue with the conditional rendering logic (e.g., an && condition failing, or the component itself not being re-rendered by React, which is highly unlikely for useState unless the component is memoized improperly or its parent isn't re-rendering).
Once you provide the requested code and the DOM presence confirmation, we can pinpoint the exact cause.
