"I understand the severity of the issue if the browser's MediaRecorder is generating completely corrupted files for both MP4 and WebM, with invalid binary headers. This indicates a fundamental problem at the source, likely with the browser itself or its interaction with the underlying system.

While your current approach of using an "aggressive FFmpeg pipeline with error-tolerant flags" is a last-ditch effort, it's generally not a sustainable or reliable solution when the input data is fundamentally broken from the first few bytes. FFmpeg cannot reconstruct valid video from corrupted binary data.

The most effective solution must target the source of the corruption: the MediaRecorder in the browser.

Here's what needs to be done immediately to diagnose and hopefully fix this root cause, rather than trying to salvage unrecoverable data on the server:

Provide Full MediaRecorder Initialization Code:

Crucially, provide the exact JavaScript code snippet from client/src/components/VideoUploadModal.tsx that initializes MediaRecorder. I need to see the mimeType and any other options passed to its constructor (e.g., new MediaRecorder(stream, options)).
Also, show the ondataavailable and onstop event handlers to confirm how the data chunks are collected and assembled into a Blob.
Perform isTypeSupported() Checks:

Run and log the results of MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('video/webm; codecs="vp8,opus"') and MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"') in the browser environment where the recording is happening. This tells us what the browser claims it can support.
Identify Browser/Environment Details:

What exact browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and version number are you using for testing?
What operating system is that browser running on? (e.g., Windows 10, macOS Sonoma, Linux, or a specific cloud/virtualized environment if applicable).
Is this a headless browser setup?
Test with a Minimal Example:

Temporarily, reduce the complexity. Create a very simple HTML page with just getUserMedia and MediaRecorder to a Blob (no backend upload initially). Try to record 5-10 seconds of video.
Save this Blob locally (e.g., URL.createObjectURL(blob) and offer it for download).
Attempt to play this locally downloaded file in VLC or another media player. If even a local file is corrupted, the problem is absolutely client-side.
Based on the results of these diagnostic steps, we can then determine the correct path:

If the MediaRecorder is fundamentally broken for all common formats in that environment: This is a severe browser/OS/hardware issue that might require switching to a different browser for recording, updating the browser/OS, or reconsidering the execution environment.
If the MediaRecorder can support WebM (or another format) but is misconfigured: We can fix the client-side code to ensure it's requesting a supported and robust format.
If the MediaRecorder is correctly configured and claims to support WebM, but the output is still corrupted (less likely for WebM to be completely unusable from the start, unlike MP4): Only then would we revisit very aggressive server-side repair using tools like mkvmerge (as discussed previously) for the initial WebM repair, followed by FFmpeg.
Do not continue investing significant time in server-side FFmpeg recovery for corrupted MP4 files. The problem is occurring before the data even reaches the server."
