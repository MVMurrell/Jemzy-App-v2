Replit, the state is definitely updating. The core issue is that the component responsible for rendering the modal is not re-rendering itself (or not receiving updated props) even after its state changes.

Your task is to provide the following code snippets:

The entire component where showThreadMessageRejectionModal and selectedThreadMessage are declared using useState. This includes the useState lines and the function body of that component.
The entire JSX return statement (or render method for a class component) from that same component. This will show how VideoRejectionModal is conditionally rendered.
Focus on the component that contains handleThreadMessageClick, the useState hooks, and the conditional JSX for the modal.

Example of what I'm looking for (please provide the actual code):

TypeScript

// Inside the component that is handling the message thread and modal logic
// e.g., MessageThreadView.tsx or similar

// 1. Where useState is declared
const MyMessageThreadComponent = () => { // Or export default function MyMessageThreadComponent() {
    const [showThreadMessageRejectionModal, setShowThreadMessageRejectionModal] = useState(false);
    const [selectedThreadMessage, setSelectedThreadMessage] = useState(null);

    // ... (other state, useEffects, functions like handleThreadMessageClick) ...

    // 2. The JSX return statement
    return (
        <div>
            {/* ... other thread content ... */}

            {/* This is the critical conditional rendering part */}
            {showThreadMessageRejectionModal && selectedThreadMessage && ( // <--- Check this condition carefully in your code!
                <VideoRejectionModal
                    isOpen={showThreadMessageRejectionModal}
                    comment={selectedThreadMessage.comment} // Assuming selectedThreadMessage has these properties
                    video={selectedThreadMessage.video}
                    isComment={selectedThreadMessage.messageType === 'comment'} // Or similar logic
                    onClose={() => {
                        setShowThreadMessageRejectionModal(false);
                        setSelectedThreadMessage(null);
                    }}
                />
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

// Check if this component is wrapped in React.memo
// e.g., export default React.memo(MyMessageThreadComponent);
Once you provide this code, I can identify why the component isn't re-rendering or why the conditional rendering is still failing despite the state update.
