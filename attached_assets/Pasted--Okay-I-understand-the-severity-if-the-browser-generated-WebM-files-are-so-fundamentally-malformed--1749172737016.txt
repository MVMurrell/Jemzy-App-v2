"Okay, I understand the severity if the browser-generated WebM files are so fundamentally malformed that even ffmpeg -c copy fails. This is indeed a challenging scenario.

Your "dual approach" of trying MP4 recording first, with a fallback to a "raw data extraction and reconstruction" for WebM, requires careful consideration.

MP4 Recording at Source (Primary Approach):

Yes, this is the correct primary approach to pursue. If the browser can consistently record directly to MP4 (H.264/AAC), it completely bypasses the WebM EBML header problem, which is ideal for simplifying the backend.
Action: Please confirm the exact MediaRecorder MIME type string you are now requesting in client/src/components/VideoUploadModal.tsx (e.g., video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2").
WebM Fallback with "Raw Data Extraction and Reconstruction":

I have significant concerns about this fallback. "Raw data extraction and reconstruction" for severely malformed WebM files is an extremely complex, fragile, and non-standard method. It is highly prone to errors, potential data corruption, and is very difficult to maintain or guarantee consistent results across varied browser MediaRecorder outputs. This is generally a last resort for very niche cases and often indicates the underlying format is too broken to be reliably handled.
Instead of "raw data extraction and reconstruction" for the WebM fallback, I strongly recommend a more robust (though potentially still challenging) alternative if MP4 recording proves insufficient for key browsers:

Alternative WebM Fallback: Consider mkvmerge (MKVToolNix) for Initial Repair. If MP4 recording fails in a user's browser and you must fall back to WebM, a dedicated Matroska tool like mkvmerge is often much more tolerant and effective at repairing or remuxing even severely malformed WebM/MKV files than FFmpeg's general-purpose remuxing. It's built specifically for these container formats.
The flow would be: Raw WebM -> mkvmerge (remux/repair) -> then FFmpeg (transcode to MP4) -> Bunny.net.
Please proceed with the MP4-first approach in the browser.

After implementing the MP4-first recording with the WebM fallback, I need you to:

Explicitly state the MediaRecorder MIME type being requested in the client.
Perform rigorous testing on the recording functionality across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari/iOS, Edge) and report the results for each browser. It's crucial to know if MP4 recording works reliably.
For any successful recording (whether MP4 or WebM fallback), provide the complete backend logs. This is crucial to verify:
The exact format of the file received by the server.
How the server's "dual processing strategy" handles that specific format.
The GCS upload, Video AI analysis, Bunny.net upload, and final moderation outcome.
Your primary focus should be to ensure the MP4-first recording is stable and robust across the browsers you intend to support. Only if that proves insufficient for a key set of users should the WebM fallback be revisited, and then, ideally, with a more robust tool like mkvmerge rather than a custom "raw data extraction" method."
