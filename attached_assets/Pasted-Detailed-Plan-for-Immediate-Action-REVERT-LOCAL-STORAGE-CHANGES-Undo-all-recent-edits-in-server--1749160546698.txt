Detailed Plan for Immediate Action:

REVERT LOCAL STORAGE CHANGES:

Undo all recent edits in server/bunnyService.ts, server/simpleVideoProcessor.ts, and any frontend files that implemented local video storage or playback as a "temporary solution."
The system must rely solely on Bunny.net Stream for video hosting and playback.
DIAGNOSE AND FIX BUNNY.NET STREAM UPLOAD (0 bytes / 404):

The "0 bytes, 0 seconds" on Bunny.net is the critical symptom. This means either:
The MP4 file generated by FFmpeg on the backend is genuinely empty or corrupted before being sent to Bunny.net.
The requests.put call to Bunny.net Stream is not sending the file data correctly, or Bunny.net's API is rejecting it for a subtle reason.
Implement comprehensive server-side validation/logging immediately before and after the Bunny.net Stream API call:
After FFmpeg processing (on processed_video_path):
Log os.path.getsize(processed_video_path). If this is 0 or very small, the FFmpeg command itself is still failing to produce a valid output file.
Run ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams <processed_video_path> and log its output. This will tell us definitively if the FFmpeg output file is valid and has detected streams/duration. If ffprobe fails or shows no streams, that's the core issue.
During create_bunny_stream_video (in app.py or worker):
Ensure the requests.put call is correctly sending the file. Sometimes data=f.read() can be problematic for large files as it reads the entire file into memory; consider data=f which streams the file from disk.
Crucial: Log the full response.status_code and response.text from the requests.put call to Bunny.net for both the initial video object creation and the subsequent file upload. Bunny.net will often provide specific error messages here if the upload failed.
IMPROVE FRONTEND USER EXPERIENCE (Accurate Status):

Initial Upload: When the frontend receives the 202 Accepted response from the backend, it should NOT display "success." Instead, it should transition to a "Processing..." state.
Profile/Video List Display:
When a new video is added to the user's profile/feed, it should initially show with a distinct "Processing" status/icon (e.g., a spinning gear, a grayed-out thumbnail, or a dedicated "Processing" text overlay).
The video should NOT be immediately playable or linked to a Bunny.net CDN URL until processing is complete.
The profile/feed should be dynamically updated when the video's status changes from 'processing' to 'approved' (or 'flagged').
Notification: The user should receive a notification (via the in-app notification system or simple console log for now) only when the backend processing (FFmpeg, GCS, Video AI, Bunny.net Stream upload) is genuinely complete and the video is ready for playback.
What to Focus On for Replit AI:

"Your logs indicate the asynchronous system is initiated correctly (202 Accepted), but the subsequent Bunny.net upload is failing. The "0 bytes, 0 seconds" confirms the video is not being properly ingested by Bunny.net Stream. This is the bottleneck.

Please prioritize fixing the Bunny.net Stream ingestion issue. The local storage workaround is not a viable solution and must be reverted.

Steps to focus on:

Revert any code that stores videos locally for immediate playback.
Add ffprobe verification: After FFmpeg processes the video (e.g., processed_video_path), run ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams <processed_video_path> on that output file. Log its complete output. This will confirm if FFmpeg is truly producing a valid, non-empty video file.
Enhanced Bunny.net Stream upload logging:
In the create_bunny_stream_video helper, log the full response.status_code and response.text from both the POST request to create the video object and the PUT request to upload the actual file. This will provide Bunny.net's specific error messages.
Ensure the requests.put call uses data=f (where f is the opened file handle) to stream the file, rather than data=f.read() which can cause memory issues or incomplete uploads for larger files.
Refactor Frontend UX:
Change the frontend message from "success" to "Video upload initiated. Processing..." upon receiving the 202.
Implement a 'pending' state for videos on the user's profile/feed that hides playback and shows an "Processing" icon/text.
The video should only become playable and appear as fully 'done' when the backend has confirmed the video is fully processed, moderated, and ready on Bunny.net Stream. This will require a mechanism to update the frontend status (e.g., polling a status endpoint or via WebSockets)."
